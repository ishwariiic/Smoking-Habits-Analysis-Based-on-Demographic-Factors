# Smoking-Habits-Analysis-Based-on-Demographic-Factors
Smoking Habits Analysis Based on Demographic  Factors-Performing Chi-Square Test on Dataset using Python-â€”This project focuses on an in-depth analysis of smoking
 behaviors with a focus on understanding the association between
 smoking habits and gender. The primary objective is to assess if
 smoking behavior is influenced by gender and other demographic
 factors such as age, income, and education level. This study
 includes a statistical hypothesis test, exploratory data analysis,
 feature reduction through Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
 and classification modeling. The findings provide insights into the
 demographic factors influencing smoking behaviors and highlight
 significant predictors for potential health interventions. 

 
  **INTRODUCTION**

  
 **Background**: Smoking is a global public health concern
 with well-documented risks. Demographic factors can influ
ence smoking habits, with previous studies suggesting cor
relations between smoking and factors such as gender, age,
 income, and education.
 
 **Objective**: This project aims to evaluate the relationship
 between smoking behavior and demographic characteristics,
 specifically analyzing the dependence of smoking habits on
 gender. We will employ statistical testing and data analysis
 to assess these relationships and build a predictive model to
 classify smoking behavior.
 
**Significance** Insights from this study can help in creating
 targeted anti-smoking campaigns and healthcare initiatives by
 identifying demographic groups more prone to smoking.
 
** What Is a Chi-Square Test?**

 The Chi-Square test is a statistical procedure for determin
ing the difference between observed and expected data. This
 test can also be used to determine whether it correlates to the
 categorical variables in our data. It helps to find out whether a
 difference between two categorical variables is due to chance
 or a relationship between them. In this test:
 
1]Variance is double the times the number of degrees of
 freedom.
 
 2]Mean distribution is equal to the number of degrees of
 freedom.
 
 3]When the degree of freedom increases, the Chi-Square
 distribution curve becomes normal
